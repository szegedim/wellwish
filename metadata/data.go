// You need to update this file to fine tune your implementation of WellWish
// The design goal is to omit any json, yaml, xml configuration files being (i.e. devops)
// The solution runs as go run anyway making .go and .yaml obsolete
// Traditionally these were separate having different teams to fine tune and slow compilation
// Nowadays Golang building is fast, and it is more secure to have the open source code shipped in the container
// This makes it easy for distributors to verify what is actually running

// This is an example to fine tune a new docker image
// (docker pull registry.gitlab.com/eper.io/<project> | grep 'Downloaded newer image') && docker build -t example.com/wellwish . && docker push example.com/wellwish

// NodePattern is easy to validate and a simple health script tells the nodes that are active.
// The system scans the cluster at startup.
// This is typically an internal node range
// You can use "10.55.0.0/21" for Kubernetes clusters
// GKE specific setting example:
// var NodePattern = "10.45.128.0/17"
// Standalone container
// var NodePattern = "127.0.0.1/32"
// Run Unit Tests
// var NodePattern = "http://127.0.0.1:77**"
// Suitable for local unit tests:
